# BeyondTravelling
Capstone Project - Built using Java, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Spring and our own API.
First of all, fork this project from the GitHub website and save it locally.
Then, drag and drop the server folder into IntelliJ(you might need to download this program to run the backend). Once you have the Server folder open, click on the hammer to build the project and then run it by clicking the green "play" button.
To run the frontend cd into: client and then new_app folders. On your terminal do an "npm install" and then "npm start"
